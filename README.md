# expo-geofence-example

I have created this demo project to check the implementation of [expo-location](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/location/) package using [Location.startGeofencingAsync](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/location/#locationstartgeofencingasynctaskname-regions) method. I have tested this in android emulator and it's working fine. App will ask you to provide few permission to run a geofence.
